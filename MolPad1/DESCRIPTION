Description: This package provides a visualization dashboard tool for understanding the dynamics of molecular co-expression in microbiome multi-omics. The main idea for addressing the issue is to first use a cluster network to overview multi-omic relationships and then support interactivity to zoom into specific features of interest. We also support a focus-plu-context analysis strategy that links to online curated annotations.
