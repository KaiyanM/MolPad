# Load Data
Fungal gardens serve as an external digestive system for the fungus-growing ant, with mutualistic fungi in the genus Leucoagaricus converting the plant substrate into energy. This dataset is collected from soil sample of the fungal garden that gradually infected over time by a pathogenic fungus, Escovopsis. The goal is to study the dynamic system and analyzed the bacterial taxa present in this system to capture the community shifts and map the detected activity in space.
```{r}
data("fungal_garden")
head(fungal_dlist)
head(pathway)
```

# Preprocess
## data input
We first reshape the datalist into our standard format. The type column is to describe datasets from the input, and if not specified, the type will be auto-filled with "dataset 1", "dataset 2", etc.
```{r}
a <- pre_process(fungal_dlist,typenameList = c("Peptide","Metabolite","Lipid"))
head(a)
```

## cluster input
Then we generate clusters from the long dataset above. The number of clusters can be adjusted according to the elbow method plot in `b[[2]]`, where we picked one close to the inflection point.
```{r}
b <- gClusters(a,ncluster = 15)
b[[1]]
b[[2]]
```
## network input
After that, we got the network result from the clusters. We pick top 5 predictors for each feature, and save the network output for future use.
```{r}
networkres <- gNetwork(b,ntop = 5)
```

Users could also view more details of the results with the following function:
```{r}
#gNetwork_view(networkres)
```

# Run Dashboard
Name the title and declare the annotation, and then run the dashboard.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
gDashboard(a,b,pathway,networkres,
           dashboardtitle = "MolPad Dashboard",
           annotation="ko_term")
```
