To effectively navigate the dashboard generated by MolPad, you'll follow three main steps:

## 1. Choose a Primary Functional Annotation and Adjust Edge Density
Start by selecting a primary functional annotation from the available options. Then, fine-tune the edge density by adjusting the threshold value on the importance score. Nodes that turn bright green indicate clusters containing the most features related to the chosen functional annotation.

## 2. Explore the Network
Brushing on the network unveils patterns of taxonomic composition and typical trajectories. You can also zoom into specific taxonomic annotations by applying filters.

## 3. Investigate Feature Details and Related Function Annotations
Delve into the feature table to examine the specifics of the features within the selected clusters. Explore additional related function annotations using the drop-down options. Click on the provided links to access online information about the items of interest. The interface encourages iterative exploration, enabling you to conduct multiple steps to answer specific questions, such as comparing pattern distributions between two functions or identifying functionally important community members metabolizing a feature of interest.

# Examples

Here's an illustrative example showcasing how to discover related patterns using the network plot:

By following these steps, you can easily leverage the MolPad dashboard to gain insights into your data, identify significant patterns, and make informed decisions based on the network analysis.
