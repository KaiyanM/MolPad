abstract = {Microbiomes are integral components of diverse ecosystems, and increasingly recognized for their roles in the health of humans, animals, plants, and other hosts. Given their complexity (both in composition and function), the effective study of microbiomes (microbiomics) relies on the development, optimization, and validation of computational methods for analyzing microbial datasets, such as from marker-gene (e.g., 16S rRNA gene) and metagenome data. This review describes best practices for benchmarking and implementing computational methods (and software) for studying microbiomes, with particular focus on unique characteristics of microbiomes and microbiomics data that should be taken into account when designing and testing microbiomics methods.}

abstract = {Abstract KEGG is a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of large-scale molecular datasets, such as genome and metagenome sequences. It accumulates experimental knowledge about high-level functions of the cell and the organism represented in terms of KEGG molecular networks, including KEGG pathway maps, BRITE hierarchies, and KEGG modules. By the process called KEGG mapping, a set of protein coding genes in the genome, for example, can be converted to KEGG molecular networks enabling interpretation of cellular functions and other high-level features. Here we report a new version of KEGG Mapper, a suite of KEGG mapping tools available at the KEGG website (https://www.kegg.jp/ or https://www.genome.jp/kegg/), together with the KOALA family tools for automatic assignment of KO (KEGG Orthology) identifiers used in the mapping.},

    abstract = {One of the pressing open problems of computational systems biology is the elucidation of the topology of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) using high throughput genomic data, in particular microarray gene expression data. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},
