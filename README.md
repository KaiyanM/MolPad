# MolPad
Multi-Omics Longitudinal Pattern Dynamic Dashboard with Network

## Overview

MolPad provides a visualization dashboard tool for understanding the dynamics of molecular co-expression in microbiome multi-omics. The main idea for addressing the issue is to reduce dimensionality using a cluster network and then enable navigation across several levels of detail using focus–plus–context visualizations. We support an overview and detailed interactive analysis of these data and links to online curated annotations.
